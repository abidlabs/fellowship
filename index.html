    <p>The Fatima Al-Fihri Predoctoral Fellowship 2021 is a 9-month program in which computer science students from around the world, who are planning on applying to PhD programs in the United States, work with current PhD students or researchers on research projects to strengthen their applications. The Fellowship is named after Fatima Al-Fihri who established in 859 CE the oldest-running university in the world, an international university for immigrants in Fez, Morocco.</p>
    <h2>Who's eligible?</h2>
    <p>Any student around the world who is interested in applying to PhD programs in 2021 or 2022 in computer science or any of its subfields such as machine learning is eligible. We expect most applicants to be juniors, seniors, or Master's students, but this is not necessarily a criterion for the fellowship.</p>
    <h2>What are the benefits to Fellows?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Working closely with an experienced researcher. All of our mentors have published research papers in top conferences in computer science and have experience with a specific field of CS/ML.</li>
      <li>Receiving coaching and mentorship for the PhD application process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What are the expectations of Fellows?</h2>
    <p>Fellows should expect to be actively engaged in a research project with their research mentor from March to October (10-20 hrs / week of independent research + 1 hr / week meeting with their mentors). From October to December, Fellows will focus on preparing their PhD applications, but may continue to wrap up / publish their research projects.</p>
    <p>The Fellows for 2021 have been selected and applications are currently closed.</p>
